# TASKS.md — Iteration Control

## Weekly Business Signal Brief (WBSB)

This document tracks the current active iteration tasks.
Full roadmap with all planned iterations: see `project-iterations.md`.

---

## Development Rules

- One task at a time. One task per PR.
- Plan Mode required for multi-file or behavioral changes.
- Only modify files explicitly allowed in each task.
- Always run before committing:
  - `pytest`
  - `ruff check .`
- No architectural rewrites unless explicitly defined.
- No silent error handling (`except: pass` is forbidden).
- No refactors outside allowed task scope.

# Iteration 6 — Historical Memory & Trend Awareness

## Theme
Give the system memory across weeks. Every report today is stateless — it compares only the current week to the prior week. With historical context the system detects trajectories, consecutive signal patterns, and whether a metric is recovering or compounding.

## Goal
Pass multi-week trend facts to the LLM so it can produce situation summaries and key stories that reference trajectory — not just this-week delta.

Full task detail: see `../iterations/i6/tasks.md`.

# Iteration 7 — Evaluation Framework & Operator Feedback Loop

## Theme
Add a quality control layer around LLM output and a lightweight operator feedback loop. Every LLM run is automatically scored for grounding, signal coverage, and hallucination risk. Operators can label report sections; feedback is stored and queryable via CLI.

Full task detail: see `../iterations/i7/tasks.md`.

# Iteration 9 — Deployment & Delivery

## Theme
Take WBSB from a local CLI tool to a deployed product: push delivery to Teams/Slack, automated scheduling, feedback webhook, Docker packaging, and secrets hardening.

Full task detail: see `../iterations/i9/tasks.md`.

## Task Overview

| Task | Owner | Description | Status |

| I9-10 | Claude | Final cleanup + merge to main | ✅ Done — this PR |

---

## Definition of Done — I9

All acceptance criteria met:

- **Delivery layer:** `wbsb deliver --run-id` and `wbsb run --deliver` dispatch to Teams/Slack via config-driven orchestrator; all delivery failures captured as `DeliveryResult` (never raises)
- **Scheduler:** `wbsb run --auto --watch-dir` discovers and processes the latest unprocessed file; path traversal guard and oversized file guard in place; scheduler boundary enforced (auto mode does not trigger delivery)
- **Feedback webhook:** `POST /feedback` validates run_id (regex), section, label (allowlists); body capped at 4096 bytes; UUID-only file paths; comment never logged; audit log limited to run_id/section/label
- **Docker:** image builds cleanly; `.env` excluded from image; runtime directories created; secrets injected at runtime only
- **CLI:** `wbsb feedback serve`, `wbsb feedback list/summary/export` all operational
- **Failure alerting:** LLM fallback and pipeline error alerts dispatched via delivery config; no silent failures — all alert dispatch failures emit visible warnings
- **Security:** no hardcoded secrets; no webhook URLs logged at INFO; no stack traces in HTTP error responses
- **Tests:** 391 passing (up from 324 baseline); ruff clean; all 6 golden eval cases pass
- **I9-9 findings resolved:** scheduler delivery boundary enforced; silent `except: pass` replaced with warnings; `RUN_ID_PATTERN` consolidated to single source of truth in `store.py`

# Iteration 11 — Security Hardening & Production Readiness

## Theme
Move WBSB from a secured MVP to a defensible system for shared or hosted use. Add cryptographic authentication, replay protection, abuse controls, runtime hardening, supply chain scanning, and structured security observability to the feedback webhook.

Full task detail: see `../iterations/i11/tasks.md`.

## Iteration 11 — Definition of Done

**HMAC Authentication (I11-1, I11-2)**
- [x] `verify_hmac(body, timestamp, signature, secret)` verifies HMAC-SHA256 with constant-time comparison
- [x] `verify_timestamp(ts)` enforces ±300 s freshness window
- [x] `NonceStore.check_and_record(nonce)` rejects replays within TTL window; capacity capped at 10,000
- [x] All auth functions covered by unit tests

**Rate Limiting (I11-3)**
- [x] Per-IP limit: 10 requests per 60 s sliding window
- [x] Global circuit breaker: 100 requests per 60 s
- [x] `RateLimitOutcome` enum: `allowed`, `per_ip_exceeded`, `global_exceeded`
- [x] Rate limiter covered by unit tests

**Security Observability (I11-4)**
- [x] `log_security_event()` emits structured JSON with `event`, `source_ip`, and context kwargs
- [x] `pseudonymize_ip()` hashes IPs with one-way SHA-256 — never logs raw IPs
- [x] Named event constants: `EVENT_AUTH_FAILURE`, `EVENT_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `EVENT_REPLAY_DETECTED`, `EVENT_FEEDBACK_RECEIVED`, `EVENT_INVALID_INPUT`

**Server Integration (I11-5)**
- [x] Request handling order enforced: HTTPS → rate limit → headers → timestamp → HMAC → nonce → body validation → storage
- [x] Dev bypass: `WBSB_ENV=development` skips steps 2–5; rate limiting always applies
- [x] `wbsb feedback serve` exits 1 with clear error if `WBSB_FEEDBACK_SECRET` unset in production
- [x] `log_security_event` called at every rejection point with pseudonymized IP
- [x] Error responses never include stack traces, exception messages, file paths, or Python version strings
- [x] Body cap (4096 bytes) checked before reading

**Runtime Hardening (I11-6)**
- [x] Dockerfile uses non-root user `wbsb` (uid 1000)
- [x] `feedback/` directory created with `chmod 700` — not world-readable
- [x] `runs/` directory created with `chmod 755`

**Supply Chain (I11-7)**
- [x] All dependencies pinned to exact versions in `requirements.txt`
- [x] `pip-audit` passes with zero known vulnerabilities
- [x] Trivy scan passes with zero HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities in the Docker image
- [x] Multi-stage Docker build separates builder from runtime

**Quality**
- [x] 443 tests passing (391 baseline + 52 from I11)
- [x] Ruff clean
- [x] All 6 golden eval cases pass
- [x] I11-8 architecture review: PASS (zero findings)
- [x] `main` branch stable
